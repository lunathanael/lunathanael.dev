# Mancala-console

The board game of Mancala is implemented in a command line interface. Supports human interface, min-max algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunathanael/Klondike.git
```

The project was developed using C++11 and compiled using Make. Compile using the commands below:
```bash
make
make release
```

## Strength
The Alpha Beta engine can outperform most human opponents.
Results for Perft-test of depth 10:

## Usage
The syntax for the available functions can be found in the headers. To start a game:
```C++
GAMESTATE gamestate;
start_game(&gamestate);
```
The game loop function requires a reference to the two engines and optional parameters.
``` c++
int game_loop(
  GAMESTATE* gamestate, 
  int (*player_a)(GAMESTATE* gs, int),
  int (*player_b)(GAMESTATE* gs, int), 
  bool print_output = false, 
  int opt_A = -1, 
  int opt_B = -1
  );
```

## Console Commands 

**quit** - exits the console loop and closes the application.\

**newgame** - starts a new game.\

**perft x** - runs a perft test with depth x.\

**d** - displays the current board state.\

**help** - displays a help menu for the hole locations.\

**game** - starts a game with engines given and optional parameters.\

### Example 
``` bash
game eng1 eng2 print_output opt1 opt2
game 3 3 1 16 16
```
### Engine indexes:

```c++
...
enum ENGINES
{
  HUMAN_PLAYER = 0, RANDOM_PLAYER = 1, MIN_MAX_PLAYER = 2, ALPHA_BETA_PLAYER = 3
}
...
```

**simulate** - simulates a number of games with given parameters.
``` bash
simulate eng1 eng2 number_of_games opt1 opt2
simulate 3 3 100 16 16
```

**board** - parses a board string.
```bash
board 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0
```

For human moves, input the index number of the hole selected. For help on indexing, reference the `help` command.


## Options
The rules for the game are defined in the `defs.h` header file, most settings can be changed without issue.

```c++
#define NUMBER_OF_HOUSES_PER_SIDE 6
#define NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS 2
#define STARTING_SEEDS_PER_HOUSE 4
static constexpr int ALLOW_CAPTURES = 1;
static constexpr int CAPTURE_BOTH = 1;
static constexpr int CAPTURE_ON_ONE_CYCLE = 0; // wtf?
static constexpr int ALLOW_RELAY_SOWING = 0;
static constexpr int ALLOW_MULTIPLE_LAPS = 1;

static constexpr int NUMBER_OF_TOTAL_HOUSES = (2 * NUMBER_OF_HOUSES_PER_SIDE);
static constexpr int NUMBER_OF_TOTAL_HOLES = (NUMBER_OF_TOTAL_HOUSES + NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS);
static constexpr int TOTAL_SEEDS_COUNT = (NUMBER_OF_TOTAL_HOUSES * STARTING_SEEDS_PER_HOUSE);

static constexpr int PLAYER_TO_STORE_INDEX[2] = { 6, 13 };
static constexpr int A_HOLE_RANGE[6] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
static constexpr int B_HOLE_RANGE[6] = { 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 };
...
```
